Description: Keep track of the overall completion of many disparate processes
 Track complex hierarchies of asynchronous task completion statuses.  This is
 intended to give you a way of recording and reporting the progress of the big
 recursive fan-out and gather type workflows that are so common in async.
 .
 What you do with this completion data is up to you, but the most common use
 case is to feed it to one of the many progress bar modules.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
